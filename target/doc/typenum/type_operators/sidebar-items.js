It provides a similar functionality to the function `core::cmp::Ord::cmp` but for types.Example"],["Pow","A **type operator** that provides exponentiation by repeated squaring.Example"],["Same","A **type operator** that ensures that `Rhs` is the same as `Self`, it is mainly useful for writing macros that can take arbitrary binary or unary operators.`Same` is implemented generically for all types; it should never need to be implemented for anything else.Note that Rust lazily evaluates types, so this will only fail for two different types if the `Output` is used.Example"]]});
