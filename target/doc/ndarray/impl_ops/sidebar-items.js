initSidebarItems({"trait":[["ScalarOperand","Elements that can be used as direct operands in arithmetic with arrays.For example, `f64` is a `ScalarOperand` which means that for an array `a`, arithmetic like `a + 1.0`, and, `a * 2.`, and `a += 3.` are allowed.In the description below, let `A` be an array or array view, let `B` be an array with owned data, and let `C` be an array with mutable data.`ScalarOperand` determines for which scalars `K` operations `&A @ K`, and `B @ K`, and `C @= K` are defined, as ***right hand side operands***, for applicable arithmetic operators (denoted `@`).***Left hand side*** scalar operands are not related to this trait (they need one `impl` per concrete scalar type); but they are still implemented for the same types, allowing operations `K @ &A`, and `K @ B` for primitive numeric types `K`.This trait ***does not*** limit which elements can be stored in an array in general. Non-`ScalarOperand` types can still participate in arithmetic as array elements in in array-array operations."]]});
